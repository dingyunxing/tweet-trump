Stay safe!Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do."@sdcritic:  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary !""@FiIibuster: @jeffzeleny Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter."@JoeBowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !"  @CNN still doesn't get it. They will never learn!"@HighonHillcrest: @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN"Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegallyTrump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead." So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sadthis election. That is a direct threat to our democracy." She then said, "We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald --of position." Then, separately she stated, "He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -Hillary's debate answer on delay: "That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will changeThe Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated &amp; demoralized DemsFidel Castro is dead!I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead. Happy Th… https://t.co/RY9mGGjrXmBus crash in Tennessee so sad &amp; so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered!I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people!The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today. Look forward to it!'Jeff Sessions, a Fitting Selection for Attorney General'

https://t.co/UFdLWtwBEQ https://t.co/MrPaG7OziQGreat meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not niceMany people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!.@transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days. https://t.co/HTgPXfPWeJI have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behaviorThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no MexicoMy transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGAAustralia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easilyThe debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet https://t.co/wPk7QWpK8ZBusy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!Happy 241st birthday to the U.S. Marine Corps! Thank you for your service!! https://t.co/Lz2dhrXzo4Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again.
